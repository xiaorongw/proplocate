## PropLocate


### Problem Statement
Property buyers are currently unable to take charge of the property buying process. They have to rely on property agents who may not always understand their criteria, or property sites that do not give them the flexibility to find and compare houses by their own set of criteria.

### Why PropLocate?
PropLocate is an application that empowers users to filter and make personalised property searches based on their own set of criteria. It enables users the freedom to compare and contrast various properties and ensure that their criterias are met, before even taking the first step to view the property.
